When his bloodthirsty urges can’t be ignored any longer, Dexter must learn to channel his inner darkness. With the guidance of his father, Harry (Golden Globe® winner Christian Slater), he adopts a Code designed to help him find and kill people who deserve to be eliminated from society without getting on law enforcement’s radar. This is a particular challenge for young Dexter as he begins a forensics internship at the Miami Metro Police Department. Patrick Dempsey, Molly Brown, James Martinez, Christina Milian, Alex Shimizu, Reno Wilson and special guest star, Sarah Michelle Gellar also star in this new series, with Michael C. Hall returning to voice the iconic inner monologue in Dexter Morgan’s head. Witness the beginning as Dexter’s darkness first comes to light in DEXTER: ORIGINAL SIN, streaming Friday, December 13 with the Paramount+ with SHOWTIME® plan.\n\n#Dexter #Showtime #ParamountPlus\n\nParamount+ is here!

Hall stars in the hit SHOWTIME Original Series.\n\nStarring: Michael C. Hall, Julie Benz, Jennifer Carpenter, Erik King, Lauren Vélez, David Zayas, James Remar, C. S.

It was released as a surprise album through PGLang and Interscope Records on November 22, 2024. Titled after the Buick Regal model, and a follow-up to Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers (2022), GNX is Lamar's first album after his departure from longtime labels Top Dawg Entertainment and Aftermath Entertainment.\n\nLamar and Dave Free executive produced the album, which features appearances from AzChike, Dody6, Hitta J3, Peysoh, Roddy Ricch, Siete7x, SZA, Wallie the Sensei, and YoungThreat; Deyra Barrera, Sam Dew, and Ink provide additional vocal contributions throughout. Production was primarily handled by Sounwave, with additional work by Jack Antonoff, Mustard, Sean Momberger, and Kamasi Washington, among others.\n\nKendrick Lamar released his fifth studio album, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers, on May 13, 2022, to critical success, but the weakest performance of his major label albums. After concluding its accompanying concert tour in March 2024, Lamar shared on social media that he purchased a vintage, limited-run 1987 Buick Grand National Experimental (GNX).\n\nMr. Morale & the Big Steppers was Lamar's last album with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE), to which he had signed in 2005. Before his feud with Canadian rapper Drake re-escalated, he quietly departed from Aftermath Entertainment and signed a direct licensing agreement with its distributor, Interscope Records. Lamar released five standalone singles during the latest installment of their conflict, including the Billboard Hot 100-toppers \"Like That\" and \"Not Like Us\". The rapper teased a then-untitled song in the beginning of the music video for the latter. Entertainment Weekly observed its inclusion and fan speculation that it could be included in his next album; the song was revealed to be \"Squabble Up\".",

And that's why you never judge a book by its cover. Because if you judged Tamara Samsonova by her cover... you'd think she's just this sweet, lil Russian grannie who makes after-school snacks for the kiddos.\n\nBut in reality... Tamara was anything but sweet. And instead of preparing after-school snacks... she was preparing flesh... human flesh... to eat. This woman's story is wild and the crazy part is she documented everything.\n\nAlso, let me know who you want me to talk about next time. Hope you have a great rest of your week, make good choices and I'll be seeing you very soon\nxo\nBailey Sarian\n\n_________\n\n:  :    F O L L O W    M E     :  :\n\nDiscord:  https://discord.com/invite/BaileySarian\nTik Tok: https://bit.ly/3e3jL9v\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/2nbO4PR\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/2mdZtK6\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/2yT4BLV\nPinterest: http://bit.ly/2mVpXnY\nYoutube: http://bit.ly/1HGw3Og\nSnapchat: https://bit.ly/3cC0V9d\n\nRECOMMEND A STORY HERE : cases4bailey@gmail.com \n\nBusiness Related Emails : Baileysarianteam@wmeagency.com\n\nWanna Send Me Something?\nBailey Sarian\n4400 W Riverside Dr Ste 110-300,\nBurbank, CA 91505\n\n_________\n\nCHAPTERS: \n\n00:00 -  MELT X BAILEY SARIAN\n08:53 - INTRO\n10:18 - EARLY LIFE\n13:58 - A TOXIC ROOMMATE\n19:49 - THE FAILED COVERUP\n23:58 - AN INCRIMINATING DIARY \n28:15 - A CAGED TRIAL\n32:47 - TAMARA'S INSPIRATION\n36:44 - UNCONFIRMED MURDERS\n38:38 - CLOSING THOUGHTS\n\n_________\n\n:  :   PRODUCTS USED  :  :\n\nFACE\n\n-Dior Forever Skin Perfect - “1N”\nhttps://howl.link/pnbuhtmoyqjw2\n\n-MAC Studio Fix Fluid - “C4”\nhttps://howl.link/4fkmfnzwu463u\n\n-Amazing Cosmetics Amazing Concealer - “Light Honey”\nhttps://howl.link/tqf5b564hcfxp\n\n-Makeup by Mario Loose Powder Soft Blur Powder - “#2”\nhttps://howl.link/ipkd3n2pvz8aj\n\n-YSL All Hours Hyper Bronze - “#3”\nhttps://howl.link/66z1ppm4gav17\n\n-Melt Cosmetics Powder Blush - “Please” (Collab)\nhttps://www.meltcosmetics.com/products/please-powder-blush\n\n-Urban Decay Eyeshadow - “SWF” (Used as highlight)\nDiscontinued \n\n-Bobbi Brown Vitamin Enriched Face Base\nhttps://howl.link/wk8qfh1vhwue4\n\nEYES\n\n-Melt Cosmetics x Bailey Sarian Fatally Yours II Palette\nhttps://www.meltcosmetics.com/products/fatally-yours-ii-eyeshadow-palette\n\n-Melt Cosmetics x Bailey Sarian Ultra Matte Gel Liner - “Scarlet”\nhttps://www.meltcosmetics.com/products/scarlet-gel-liner\n\n-Melt Cosmetics x Bailey Sarian The BB Lash\nhttps://www.meltcosmetics.com/products/bb-lash\n\n-Lancome Mascara Grandiose\nhttps://howl.link/6t3twh081nb1y\n\n-Melt Cosmetics x Bailey Sarian Duo Chrome Eyeshadow - “Tempt”\nhttps://www.meltcosmetics.com/products/tempt-metaleyez\n\nBROWS\n\n-Jecca Blac Eyebrow Gel\nhttps://amzn.to/4eJjItk\n\n-Mac Pro Brow Definer - “Genuine Aubergine”\nhttps://howl.link/bt37eyz7tystc\n\n-Benefit Brow Microfilling Pen - “Deep Brown”\nhttps://howl.link/7qg4iin1obqqk\n\nLIPS\n\n-Melt Cosmetics Perfectionist Lip - “Cinnamon”\nhttps://howl.link/9s0f1gsaigj0a\n\n-Melt Cosmetics x Bailey Sarian Lipstick - “Circe”\nhttps://www.meltcosmetics.com/products/circe-lipstick\n\n-Melt Cosmetics x Bailey Sarian Lipgloss - “Saint”\nhttps://www.meltcosmetics.com/products/saint-lip-gloss",

Nothing will ever fill the hole\nMy heart will be here under the tree\nJust letting you know\n \nI’m alone this December\nAnd the long nights, they begin\nStill my minds overthinking now who’s arms you’re in\nAnd were mine just an afterthought of needing to be kind\nGuess when we’re out of sight it’s out of mind\n \nYou were the first touch, first look in my eyes\nNow we’re just strangers who walk by\n \nThere is nothing under the tree\nThat I wished for\nI want you to come back to me\nAnd be like before\nHave I lost you? Nothing will ever fill the hole\nMy heart will be here under the tree\nJust letting you know\n\nYou were the first touch, first look in my eyes\nNow we’re just strangers who walk by\n \nThere is nothing under the tree\nThat I wished for\nI want you to come back to me\nAnd be like before\nHave I lost you?

        "description": "Fox Sports’ lead College Football analyst Joel Klatt reacts to a crazy Saturday in College Football which saw 7 Top 20 teams lose. He breaks down what makes Ohio State so dangerous after their win over #5 Indiana before discussing the Hoosiers’ Playoff hopes after the loss. Klatt then considers the Playoff ramifications for Alabama, Ole Miss and Texas A&M after all 3 were beaten on Saturday. He also looks at the wild Big 12 race as Kansas pulled off another upset, this time against Colorado, and Arizona State survived a wild finish to keep their Cinderella run going. Finally, Klatt recaps the impact of the big news on the recruiting trail as Michigan picked up a huge commitment from #1 overall player, QB Bryce Underwood, Colorado got their 5-star successor to Shedeur Sanders and USC also got their future QB.

        "description": "In today’s video, I find an abandoned axolotl farm that is filled with axolotls, fish, turtles, frogs, and much more that were left here to die! So, my mission is to explore the entire farm to hopefully save all the animals! I started by netting around in a pond and immediately I caught some axolotls! But as I kept going I ended up finding albino axolotls which are alot\nmore rare! After that I kept netting around and I managed to catch a golden axolotl, one of the rarest in the world! I then came across a pond that was filled with crazy fish, including flowerhorns, lungfish, catfish, pufferfish, eels, freshwater sharks, and much more! But things didn’t stop there, I kept going and I started catching more axolotls, and even some baby turtles! But sadly, what I found next was a shattered fish tank filled with dead fish and axolotls… So now we have to hurry because these animals don’t have a lot of time left! I kept exploring and I managed to catch some angelfish, betta fish, and a monster albino axolotl! Things were starting to get crazy and I found a pond loaded with colorful crawfish, including orange ones, blue ones, and even white ones! I kept exploring the farm when suddenly I came across some monster fish including an albino lungfish, oscars, arowanas, and much more! But then I came across the deadliest animal so far… It was a mata mata turtle, one of the rarest turtles in the world! After exploring the rest of the farm and catching more axolotls, and albino frogs, it was now time to explore the two massive ponds filled with axolotls! So I places a fish trap in one of them and I started netting around in the other… Immediately I caught some of the biggest axolotls iv ever seen, including black ones, golden ones, and albino ones! But after a while it was now time to check the fish trap and I managed to catch a ton of axolotls, which means we successfully saved all of the animals from the abandoned farm!\n—\n⏹Subscribe to the vlog channel: https://youtube.com/@BassFishingProductionsVlogs?si=I6Kc5jFKyUa2Wf5t\n—\n⏹MERCH NOW AVAILABLE: https://bassfishingproductions.shop\n—\n⏹Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/bassfishingproductions/\n\n⏹TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@bassfishingproductions?enter_from=pc&source=h5_m\n\n⏹Business email: bassfishermanguy@gmail.com",

Chu (Crazy Rich Asians, In the Heights), Wicked is the first chapter of a two-part immersive, cultural celebration. Wicked Part Two is scheduled to arrive in theaters on November 21, 2025.\n\nWicked, the untold story of the witches of Oz, stars Emmy, Grammy and Tony winning and Oscar®-nominated powerhouse Cynthia Erivo (Harriet, Broadway’s The Color Purple) as Elphaba, a young woman misunderstood because of her green skin who has yet to discover her true power, and Grammy-winning, multi-platinum recording artist and global superstar Ariana Grande as Glinda, a popular young woman gilded by privilege who has yet to discover her true heart.\n\nThe two meet as students at Shiz University in the fantastical Land of Oz and forge an unlikely but profound friendship. Following an encounter with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, their friendship reaches a crossroads and their lives take very different paths. Their extraordinary adventures in Oz will ultimately see them fulfill their destinies as Glinda the Good and the Wicked Witch of the West.\n\nThe film also stars Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh as Shiz University’s regal headmistress Madame Morrible; Olivier Award winner and Emmy nominee Jonathan Bailey (Bridgerton, Fellow Travelers) as Fiyero, a roguish and carefree prince; Tony nominee Ethan Slater (Broadway’s Spongebob Squarepants, Fosse/Verdon) as Boq, an altruistic Munchkin student; Marissa Bode in her feature-film debut as Nessarose, Elphaba’s favored sister; and pop culture icon Jeff Goldblum as the legendary Wizard of Oz.\n\nThe cast of characters includes Pfannee and ShenShen, two conniving compatriots of Glinda played by Emmy nominee Bowen Yang (Saturday Night Live) and Bronwyn James (Harlots); a new character created for the film, Miss Coddle, played by Tony nominee Keala Settle (The Greatest Showman) and four-time Emmy winner Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones) as the voice of Dr. Dillamond.\n\nWicked is produced by Marc Platt p.g.a. (La La Land, The Little Mermaid), whose films, television shows and stage productions have earned a combined 46 Oscar® nominations, 58 Emmy nominations and 36 Tony nominations, and by multiple Tony winner David Stone (Kimberly Akimbo, Next to Normal), with whom Platt produced the blockbuster Wicked stage musical. The executive producers are Stephen Schwartz, David Nicksay, Jared LeBoff, Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox.\n\nWicked is based on the generation-defining musical stage play with music and lyrics by legendary Grammy and Oscar® winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman, from the bestselling novel by Gregory Maguire. The screenplay is by Winnie Holzman and Winnie Holzman & Dana Fox. The film score is by John Powell & Stephen Schwartz, with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz.\n\nThe Broadway stage musical is produced by Marc Platt, Universal Pictures, the Araca Group, Jon B. Platt and David Stone.",
