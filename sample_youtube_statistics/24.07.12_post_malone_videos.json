        "description": "Post Malone - ‚ÄòAUSTIN‚Äô Official Live Performances\n\nPost Malone was never simply one thing. His skills are as broad as his artistic vision is vast ‚Äì and it‚Äôs always been that way. Listen to ‚ÄúWhite Iverson‚Äù again. That 2016 nugget was just as much a pop fever dream as it was a cornerstone of Soundcloud rap. Seems like our hero has been in perpetual evolution since day one. Connect the dots between ‚Äòbeerbongs & bentleys‚Äô and ‚ÄòTwelve Carat Toothache‚Äô and you‚Äôll see a lot of territory being covered in a very logical and very compelling way. Now we‚Äôre waiting for ‚ÄòAustin,‚Äô Posty‚Äôs latest and perhaps most revealing work to date (his real name is Austin Richard Post). It arrives July 28, and the singer has told fans that it‚Äôs ‚Äúsome of the most challenging and rewarding music for me, a least ‚Äì trying to really push myself and really do some cool stuff.‚Äù To celebrate the arrival of his fifth full album, we united with Mr. Malone in SoCal last month. The results are stellar, with Post being deeply candid and deeply expressive for the cameras. Geographically and emotionally, he does it all in these three performances - strumming a guitar poolside in ‚ÄúGreen Thumb,‚Äù anguishing on the couch in ‚ÄúOverdrive,‚Äù and balancing on the roof in ‚ÄúSomething Real.‚Äù Here‚Äôs to Post, here‚Äôs to Austin. \n\nWatch music videos by Post Malone:  https://www.youtube.com/@postmalone\n\nFollow Post Malone:\nhttps://www.postmalone.com\nhttps://instagram.com/postmalone\nhttps://twitter.com/postmalone\nhttps://facebook.com/postmalone\nhttps://snapchat.com/add/postmalone\nhttps://tiktok.com/@postmalone\nhttps://discord.gg/post-malone\n\nFollow Vevo\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/vevo\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/vevo\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vevo\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Chris Pereira\nExecutive Producer: Jordy Wax\nDirectors: Skyler Brown & Seth Halter\nCreative Director, Production: Liz Hart\nLine Producer: Haley Sliger\nLine Producer: Stacey Branson\nProduction Manager: Cole Emery\nDirector Of Photography: Zoe Simone-Yi\nProduction Designer: Tyler Jensen\nMusic & Talent: Annie Shapiro + Sam Mackoff\n\nPresident, Mercury Records: Tyler Arnold\nEVP, Marketing Strategy, Republic Records: Marleny Reyes\nVP, Commerce, Republic Records: Ryan Stevens\nAssociate Director, Commerce (Video), Republic Records: Katie Baumstein\nSVP, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Tim Hrycyshyn\nSenior Director, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Allegra Chautin\n\n1st AD: Derek Jaeschke\n2nd AD: Delaney Forrey\n1st AC: Pancho Ortiz\n2nd AC: Kate Ruthenbeck\nDIT: Shawn Aguilar\nSteadicam Operator: Jose Espinoza\nCrane Camera Operator: Chris Herr\nCrane Operator: Garrett Dorin\nCrane Tech: Nazariy Hatak\nRemote Head Tech: Alexandre Nunez\n\nGaffer: Nick Durr\nBB Electric: Jasper Khadjenouri\nElectric / Driver: Victor Noel Arenal\nElectric: Justin Roxbrough\nElectric: Rodolfo Martinez\nElectric: Isaac Han\nElectric: Charlie Hayes\nBoard Operator: Patrick Mattes\n\nKey Grip: Luke Poole\nBB Grip: Justen Hernandez\nGrip: Steven Albovias\nGrip: Nick Herman\nGrip: Grayson Venters\nGrip: Ryan Elvira\n\nArt Director: Danny Erb\nSet Decorator: Michael Coursey\nLeadman: Montana Bertoletti\nSet Dresser / Shopper: Christina Skilbred\nSet Dresser: Eric Moore\nSet Dresser: Kris Ingram\nScenic Painter: Jesse Hotchkiss\nSet Dresser: Abe Turner\n\nArtist Management: Dre London\nArtist Management: Bobby Greenleaf\nArtist Management: Austin Rosen\nProduction Manager, Artist: Dennis A.

        "description": "Post Malone - Overdrive | Vevo Official Live Performance\n\nPost Malone was never simply one thing. His skills are as broad as his artistic vision is vast ‚Äì and it‚Äôs always been that way. Listen to ‚ÄúWhite Iverson‚Äù again. That 2016 nugget was just as much a pop fever dream as it was a cornerstone of Soundcloud rap. Seems like our hero has been in perpetual evolution since day one. Connect the dots between ‚Äòbeerbongs & bentleys‚Äô and ‚ÄòTwelve Carat Toothache‚Äô and you‚Äôll see a lot of territory being covered in a very logical and very compelling way. Now we‚Äôre waiting for ‚ÄòAustin,‚Äô Posty‚Äôs latest and perhaps most revealing work to date (his real name is Austin Richard Post). It arrives July 28, and the singer has told fans that it‚Äôs ‚Äúsome of the most challenging and rewarding music for me, a least ‚Äì trying to really push myself and really do some cool stuff.‚Äù To celebrate the arrival of his fifth full album, we united with Mr. Malone in SoCal last month. The results are stellar, with Post being deeply candid and deeply expressive for the cameras. With a fetching pop perspective, he‚Äôs leveling up once again, no doubt. Check this performance of ‚ÄúOverdrive,‚Äù one of the 17 songs from the new album, and stay close as we roll out more performances soon.\n\nWatch music videos by Post Malone:  https://www.youtube.com/@postmalone\n\nFollow Post Malone:\nhttps://www.postmalone.com\nhttps://instagram.com/postmalone\nhttps://twitter.com/postmalone\nhttps://facebook.com/postmalone\nhttps://snapchat.com/add/postmalone\nhttps://tiktok.com/@postmalone\nhttps://discord.gg/post-malone\n\nFollow Vevo\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/vevo\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/vevo\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vevo\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Chris Pereira\nExecutive Producer: Jordy Wax\nDirectors: Skyler Brown & Seth Halter\nCreative Director, Production: Liz Hart\nLine Producer: Haley Sliger\nLine Producer: Stacey Branson\nProduction Manager: Cole Emery\nDirector Of Photography: Zoe Simone-Yi\nProduction Designer: Tyler Jensen\nMusic & Talent: Annie Shapiro + Sam Mackoff\n\nPresident, Mercury Records: Tyler Arnold\nEVP, Marketing Strategy, Republic Records: Marleny Reyes\nVP, Commerce, Republic Records: Ryan Stevens\nAssociate Director, Commerce (Video), Republic Records: Katie Baumstein\nSVP, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Tim Hrycyshyn\nSenior Director, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Allegra Chautin\n\n1st AD: Derek Jaeschke\n2nd AD: Delaney Forrey\n1st AC: Pancho Ortiz\n2nd AC: Kate Ruthenbeck\nDIT: Shawn Aguilar\nSteadicam Operator: Jose Espinoza\nCrane Camera Operator: Chris Herr\nCrane Operator: Garrett Dorin\nCrane Tech: Nazariy Hatak\nRemote Head Tech: Alexandre Nunez\n\nGaffer: Nick Durr\nBB Electric: Jasper Khadjenouri\nElectric / Driver: Victor Noel Arenal\nElectric: Justin Roxbrough\nElectric: Rodolfo Martinez\nElectric: Isaac Han\nElectric: Charlie Hayes\nBoard Operator: Patrick Mattes\n\nKey Grip: Luke Poole\nBB Grip: Justen Hernandez\nGrip: Steven Albovias\nGrip: Nick Herman\nGrip: Grayson Venters\nGrip: Ryan Elvira\n\nArt Director: Danny Erb\nSet Decorator: Michael Coursey\nLeadman: Montana Bertoletti\nSet Dresser / Shopper: Christina Skilbred\nSet Dresser: Eric Moore\nSet Dresser: Kris Ingram\nScenic Painter: Jesse Hotchkiss\nSet Dresser: Abe Turner\n\nArtist Management: Dre London\nArtist Management: Bobby Greenleaf\nArtist Management: Austin Rosen\nProduction Manager, Artist: Dennis A.

you want me to be.\n          \nHow can I see when you cover my eyes?\nAnd can I just sleep when I‚Äôm so fucking tired?\nSo tell me right now what you want me, what you want me, what you want me to be,\n          \nOoh,\n          \nWhat you wanna do is tell me off, no,\nWhat you wanna do is fuck me up, ooh, What you not gonna do is top me off,\nSo excuse me for an hour while I love myself,\n          \nYou told me you‚Äôd protect my heart you‚Äôd be my goalie, Thinking bout the bullshit that you sold me,\nAnd I know that I ain‚Äôt perfect, but you so mean,\nWe were homies,\n          \nYou trip me up just to watch me fall,\nSmoke another cigarette wash the last one down, So down, down til I‚Äôm flat on my face,\nYou‚Äôre the reason why I get so high,\n          \nHow am I free when you hold me so tight?\nHow can I beam when you blocking my light?\nI cannot be, what you want me, what you want me, what you want me to be.\n          \nHow can I see when you cover my eyes?\nAnd can I just sleep when I‚Äôm so fucking tired?\nSo tell me right now what you want me, what you want me, what you want me to be,\n        \nGot a custom diamond ring\nand no he don‚Äôt got a wife\ngot a large amount things I can‚Äôt total the price\nI -told her I don‚Äôt need her she can leave out my life (life) You only get one try but if it‚Äôs lit we go twice (twice )\n          \n( uhuhhhhh)\nPull up in a hard top it‚Äôs a drop top (top)\nTold you we‚Äôd be multimillionaires why lie (lie)\nShe know I do not care for no pressin my mind\nThe federal skeleton on my wrist say prime-time(time) How couldn‚Äôt you just let me be me\nYou starting to be measly (measly)\nI couldn‚Äôt even find out cause you leaving me (me) You can tell I‚Äôm pure you can feel my energy (energy) Really rich we ain‚Äôt living free\nGot to keep it solid\nAnd we all agree\n          \nHow am I free when you hold me so tight?\nHow can I beam when you blocking my light?\nI cannot be, what you want me, what you want me, what you want me to be.\n          \nHow can I see when you cover my eyes?\nAnd can I just sleep when I‚Äôm so fucking tired?\nSo tell me right now what you want me, what you

Take me back to yesterday,\nWhen I was wrapped around your finger, Wrapped around your finger,\nThen was shot back down to Earth,\nWhen we met you ain‚Äôt know I was a singer,\nYou weren‚Äôt impressed by all the ice on my fingers, I had your mom and daddy‚Äôs house on my pinky,\nIf I‚Äôda known what it‚Äôd be like now,\nI wouldn‚Äôt be in misery right now, Look in the mirror I don‚Äôt see myself, Being with me has gotta be like hell,\nSo tell the devil I‚Äôma be right down!\nYou keep me wrapped around your finger, Wrapped around your finger,\nI was caught up in your orbit,\nSpinning like a bullet,\nI was wrapped around your finger, Wrapped around your finger, Then I shot back down to earth,\nI keep wondering who‚Äôs the one replacing me?

I wonder\nI go out, and all they eyes on me\nI show out, do you like what you see?\nAnd now they closin' in on me\nLet 'em sharpen all they teeth\nThis is more than I can handle\nBlood in my Lambo'\nWish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope\nI light a candle, some Palo Santo\nFor all these demons, wish I could just go on\n\nI just keep on hopin' that you call me\nYou say you wanna see me, but you can't right now\nYou never took the time to get to know me\nWas scared of losin' somethin' that we never found\nWe're running out of reasons, but we can't let go\nYeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home\n\n#PostMalone #HollywoodsBleeding\n\nMusic video by Post Malone performing Hollywood's Bleeding (Audio). ¬© 2019 Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/FZwmfz",

happened to be one of my best nights\n9 AM, I came from out the club, it was daylight (Daylight)\nGot a bad girl, I was treating her too nice (I was treating her too nice)\nCaught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need (That ain't what I need)\nYou just sold your soul, girl, quit crying (Sold your soul)\nYour passport, it looks like you lying (Know you cold)\nYou broken down by your past, don't deny it (You know I know)\nYour ex called, you was vulnerable, you flying, nah (Flying)\nWasn't on the best of terms, girl, I was trying (I was trying on ya)\nI did everything to
