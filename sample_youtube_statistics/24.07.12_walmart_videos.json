        "description": "For 20 years, Walmart has partnered with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation on the Acres for America program, helping protect over 2 million acres of critical land across the U.S. When the program started, the idea was to protect 1 acre of land for every 1 acre Walmart built on. Today it’s evolved to about 20-1! \n \nAcres for America has preserved ecosystems, bolstered biodiversity, safeguarded clean water, and created recreational spaces for the benefit of both people and wildlife. And we recently shared the exciting news that we've renewed the program for 10 more years, with a $34.5 million pledge. \n \nIn this episode of the Huddle, Chris West from NFWF and Jen Barnhouse from The Nature Conservancy joined me at the Kings River Preserve, a beautiful 5,000 acre preserve in Northwest Arkansas. We talked about the widespread impact of the Acres for America program, and how conservation isn’t just about protecting beautiful places—it’s also about sustaining natural resources for future generations. \n \nYou'll also hear how anyone can support this work, either through small actions like rounding up a purchase or by finding ways to connect with local conservation initiatives. Whether you’re passionate about the environment, want to leave a legacy for future generations, or simply enjoy outdoor recreation, this episode is for you! \n\nSave Money. Live Better.\n\nSubscribe to Walmart on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1tVy1CI  \nLike Walmart on Facebook: https://walmrt.us/4hfDtuT\nFollow Walmart on TikTok: https://walmrt.us/3YcyZwl\nFollow Walmart on X: https://walmrt.us/4fdyPvO\nFollow Walmart on Instagram: https://walmrt.us/48feJ1K\nFollow Walmart on Pinterest: https://walmrt.us/4ePPMN2",

        "description": "Monday is Veterans Day, one of the most special days of the year. At Walmart we’re so grateful to those who serve or have served in the military, and we support them however we can. A big way is through employment. We’re proud to have hired 400,000 veterans since 2013. Another way is through the products we sell. \n \nThis week I recorded a Huddle episode with Mark Doyle, whose company – Rags of Honor Brands – makes military-themed shirts we sell in stores and online. We talked about his story of starting Rags of Honor to provide jobs and support to veterans, and how working with Walmart has helped his company do even more. We're proud to partner with Rags of Honor as they serve those who have served all of us – and I know you’ll be inspired by Mark's mission-driven mindset and willingness to take action. \n \nPlease join me in thanking all the brave men and women who have worn the uniform and allowed us to live freely in this country. Let’s all honor them today and every day. Full episode here: bit.ly/3gxON5F\n\nSave Money.

        "description": "It’s #AmericanPharmacistsMonth, and I had the chance to sit down with Obi Odi, one of our pharmacists at Store #4487 in Aiken, South Carolina. Obi’s journey is remarkable. Originally from Nigeria, Obi came to the U.S. to further his education and pursue a career in pharmacy. While studying, he was deeply impacted by the events of 9/11 and decided to pause his education to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps, even though he was about to graduate! After completing that Military service, he finished his pharmacy degree and found an opportunity to continue serving his community as a pharmacist at Walmart.  \n  \nIn this episode of The Huddle, Obi shares how his role as a pharmacist allows him to connect with customers beyond their prescriptions, extending a helping hand to those who might need it most. His approach to service—whether in the Military or in the pharmacy—has always been about stepping up for others.  \n  \nObi embodies Walmart’s core values of service, respect, excellence, and integrity in everything he does, and it was my absolute honor to offer him a well-deserved promotion to Pharmacy Manager. We’re thankful for Obi’s service and proud to have so many incredible pharmacists on #TeamWalmart. You don’t want to miss this inspiring episode!\nSave Money.

        "description": "The guest for this Huddle episode needs no introduction: Kevin Costner has been part of all our lives for many years! He also personifies many of the traits we strive for at Walmart: reinventing ourselves, staying true to who we are, and delivering quality. \n \nIt was so fun to have Kevin join us at our 2024 Walmart U.S. Holiday Meeting, in Orlando, Florida. You can imagine how thousands of our associates reacted when he walked on stage! Kevin talked to the team about his work ethic, how he celebrates the holidays, and one of his products we sell in our stores and online. He even brought his band “Modern West,” and they put on an awesome performance!\n \nI know you’ll love this episode, where Kevin and I talk about how and when we found our personal “yellow brick roads” … and the difference Walmart is making in America.\n\nSave Money.

        "description": "We’ve had an exciting week in San Francisco, California, where we just wrapped up our Let's Grow! 2024 Walmart Marketplace Seller Summit for small businesses, inventors, and other sellers interested in joining our Walmart.com Marketplace. Marketplace allows us to offer customers hundreds of millions more items than we sell in our stores! \n\nFor this edition of the Huddle, I talked with Bill Pond, CEO of RTIC Outdoors. RTIC is a digitally-native brand that makes premium products like coolers and cups. They first partnered with Walmart by joining our Marketplace. As you’ll hear Bill explain in this episode, that led to more sales and more customers for RTIC, then eventually having their products inside our U.S. stores. Today RTIC’s products are sold both in our stores AND our Marketplace, and the two perfectly compliment each other.    \n\nIt was especially fun to record this episode inside Walmart Store 100, which is where I started my Walmart career 31 years ago. So much has changed since then – particularly the opportunities we now have to sell many more items and fulfill many more orders in many more ways. But what hasn’t changed? We’re still so proud to welcome new sellers with new products, and help them grow WITH us.\n\nSave Money.

        "description": "Walmart is a community of diverse individuals, each with their unique stories. Some joined us after pursuing other careers, some started with us and then moved onto something else. Then there are people like Anjie Robertson and myself who started with Walmart and saw it turn into a rewarding career. I met Anjie a couple months ago at our Manager Academy, where she shared she couldn’t attend the Associates Week she was invited to 15 years ago, because of being promoted. Anjie politely asked if she could come this year, to one of the biggest and best family reunions and celebrations in the world! \n\nAnjie joined me for this episode of The Huddle, just after joining me on stage at our U.S. Associates meeting! We talked about her 30-year career with Walmart, how her experiences have shaped her people-centered approach to management, the importance of meeting people where they are, and what it truly means to go \"all in.” We also talked about the memorable moment where Anjie recommended we begin an annual bonus program for our store associates. (Spoiler alert: we listen!) \n\nAnjie is an incredible associate with a magnetic personality, and her story shows what's possible when you take risks, believe in yourself, and go \"all in\" on your goals. I'm proud of Anjie for asking to come to Associates Week this year and I'm excited for you to hear her story in this episode. You won't want to miss it! \n\nSave Money.

        "description": "Yesterday, we celebrated the grand opening of Store 8861, our brand-new Walmart Neighborhood Market in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida! 🎉 A grand opening is always filled with excitement, and this one was particularly special. It represents the first of the 150 new stores we're planning to build or convert in the next five years along with our ongoing efforts to remodel hundreds of our existing stores to better serve our customers. \n \nIn this episode of The Huddle, I had the pleasure to chat with Brandon, the Store Manager, at this beautiful new location. His journey with Walmart has been truly inspiring. When he was a Support Manager, he had the opportunity to assist in opening a new store in Gulfport, Mississippi, and has dreamt of opening a store as a Store Manager ever since. Today, he is living that dream and is thrilled to serve the Santa Rosa community! We talked about the unique aspects of this new store, including its proximity to the beach and the capacity to cater to both locals and tourists with a larger square footage, extensive assortment, and standout pharmacy. We also talked about all the amazing long-term associates who have transferred from other stores to support this new location, bringing a wealth of experience to help the new team thrive. \n \nWe're thrilled to bring nearly 100 new jobs to the area and look forward to providing outstanding service to all of our customers on Florida’s Gulf Coast. Whether you're a local or visiting over the summer, we'd love to have you stop by and check out our new store! \n\n\nSave Money.

        "description": "I started working with Walmart when I was in school. I was just hoping to earn some money for the summer — but I soon realized that working in a store taught me many things I couldn’t have learned in a classroom. Real-world work experience is crucial, and that’s why we're proud to be a partner of the NRF Foundation's RISE Up program. RISE Up has helped 40,000 learners learn about and experience the retail industry, and build foundational employability skills. \n\nIn this episode of The Huddle, I'm joined by John Marschhausen and Lori Messi from Dublin City Schools in Ohio, who were recognized by the Foundation for the amazing work they're doing immersing students from their district into local retailers. They have great advice for how organizations and institutions can take smart risks, engage with their communities, and build partnerships to change young people’s lives. The work happening in Dublin showcases what's possible when we invest in the future leaders of tomorrow. I'm excited to see the next generation “RISE Up”!\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Walmart on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1tVy1CI  \r\nLike Walmart on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1qS59V6 \r\nFollow Walmart on Pinterest: http://bit.ly/1vR6XBY \r\nFollow Walmart on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1pMbNfy \r\nFollow Walmart on Instagram: http://bit.ly/1FMiiJX",

She’s an on-air contributor for NBC’s \"Today” show, the CEO and founder of Love Squad, and a very popular Peloton instructor. I've had the opportunity to take many of Ally’s classes and see how her dedication to fitness, wellness, and community is so inspiring to others.\n\nI was thrilled to have Ally join me on The Huddle, sharing her personal journey and passion for health – including how a life-changing accident at age nine shaped her perspective. We also talked about how she’s used her platform of influence to motivate others and build “Love Squad,” which provides women of all backgrounds with community and career development resources.\n\nAlly is full of energy and positivity, and I know you'll feel inspired by her story and her advice for thriving both personally and professionally. No matter your age, your schedule, or the shape you’re in, you can make whole health a priority every day!\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Walmart on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1tVy1CI  \r\nLike Walmart on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1qS59V6 \r\nFollow Walmart on Pinterest: http://bit.ly/1vR6XBY \r\nFollow Walmart on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1pMbNfy \r\nFollow Walmart on Instagram: http://bit.ly/1FMiiJX",

As the whole team walked me through the store sharing all the things they’re doing and how they’re showing up for their community, one thing was clear: they truly OWN their business. Adrias has built a culture where everyone is engaged and invested in the work they’re doing, and proud to impact their community. When I told Nick Berkeley I wanted to talk about my visit with all our store managers at our Year Beginning Meeting (YBM), the timing was perfect – Nick was already planning to promote Adrias to Market Manager the next day!\n \nAdrias joined me on The Huddle after that special moment in Houston. He talked about starting his journey with Walmart as a cart pusher 22 years ago, and his advice for turning a job into a successful career. We also talked about building a team and culture that showcases what taking ownership looks like. \n \nThere is so much opportunity at Walmart, and Adrias is a perfect example of all that’s possible here! I’m excited to see all he’ll accomplish in his new role as he continues inspiring others to make a difference each day. Congratulations!\n---\nSave Money. Live Better.\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Walmart on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1tVy1CI  \r\nLike Walmart on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1qS59V6 \r\nFollow Walmart on Pinterest: http://bit.ly/1vR6XBY \r\nFollow Walmart on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1pMbNfy \r\nFollow Walmart on Instagram: http://bit.ly/1FMiiJX",

Doug joined me on The Huddle to discuss this exciting news – what it means, and how it will allow even more people to become shareholders in our company. \n  \nOf course, we also talked about our favorite group of Walmart shareholders: the 400,000 associates who own Walmart stock – many who buy it through our Associate Stock Purchase benefit program. I joined that program my very first day in 1993. Sam Walton once called it “the single best thing we ever did.” \n  \nOur associates act like owners every day, and we’re delighted at how many truly ARE owners of the company because they own stock. And we’re so excited to think of what’s ahead for all of us as we keep serving more customers and growing our company. \r\n\r\nSubscribe to Walmart on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1tVy1CI  \r\nLike Walmart on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1qS59V6 \r\nFollow Walmart on Pinterest: http://bit.ly/1vR6XBY \r\nFollow Walmart on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1pMbNfy \r\nFollow Walmart on Instagram: http://bit.ly/1FMiiJX",

        "description": "As #VeteransDay approaches, I urge everyone to pause and appreciate the men and women who have served so bravely and selflessly to protect our country and freedoms. At Walmart, our commitment to supporting America’s Veterans and their families runs deep. We’re proud to have hired over 550,000 members of the military community over the last decade. \n \nSome of our newest Veteran associates have come through our Corporate Fellowship Program (CFP), which provides an innovative, 12-week experience that equips transitioning service members with professional training and hands-on learning to prepare for meaningful civilian careers. For this episode of The Huddle, I had the pleasure of talking with two current fellows – Juli and Quintin Plank. We talked about their experiences in the military, their journey to becoming part of the Walmart CFP, and their advice to other Veterans navigating to civilian life. \n \nBest of all? I was thrilled to surprise both Juli and Quintin with official offer letters to become Walmart associates! We can’t wait for them to be part of our #WalmartFamily for many years to come. Happy #VeteransDay, to Juli, Quintin and all who have served. We can’t thank you enough! https://bit.ly/3gxON5F \n\r\nSave Money.

        "description": "As #NationalManufacturingDay approaches this Friday, we're proud to recognize the manufacturers behind Walmart products, who play a pivotal role in creating opportunities for our communities and workforce. Kent International Inc. is a great example of this. They've assembled millions of bikes at their South Carolina factory, including Walmart's Ozark Trail mountain bike line, and have been instrumental in revitalizing bicycle manufacturing in the U.S.\n\nIn this episode of The Huddle, I join Arnold Kamler, CEO of Kent International Inc., at their Manning, SC factory to talk about his journey working with Walmart and how they've evolved our Ozark Trail line. Arnold also shares valuable advice for anyone considering establishing manufacturing assembly in the U.S.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my first bike was from Walmart – and I know many of our customers got their start cycling the same way. As you shop for the holidays, consider checking out Ozark Trail bikes, knowing the significant impact each one has on people right here in the United States. https://bit.ly/3gxON5F\n\r\nSave Money.

        "description": "As we celebrate Driver and Tech Appreciation Week, I want to recognize our amazing associates in Walmart's Private Fleet who play a crucial role in keeping our stores stocked, and serving our partners and customers all over the country. I also want to shine a spotlight on Emmanuel - not only is he one of our great drivers, but he's also an amazing person whose story is the true embodiment of the American dream. Originally from Uganda, Emmanuel came to the U.S. 27 years ago to support his family back home. Despite the struggle to make ends meet and being encouraged to file for bankruptcy, he joined Walmart's private fleet in 2021 – and it changed everything. Emmanuel was able to pay off $38,000 in debt, avoid bankruptcy, improve his credit score by over 200 points, and even buy a home this summer - something he never thought would be possible.\n\n\n\nIn this episode of the Huddle, Emmanuel and I talk about his incredible journey and how his heart for service helped him overcome every hardship. He is a testament to the life-changing opportunities Walmart provides for our associates, and I know you’ll be inspired listening to his story. We're so grateful to have Emmanuel and all our dedicated drivers and techs on our team, making the difference in countless lives every day. Thank you for all that you do!\n\n\r\nSave Money.

        "description": "This week we’ve been celebrating America’s 247th birthday! Our Walmart U.S. team is honored to serve this great country, and one of the most impactful ways we do that is selling products that come from this country. We’re proud that about 2/3rds of our product spend is on items made, grown or assembled in the U.S.\n\nFor this Huddle episode, I visited an Arkansas rice farm with one of our merchants, Melody Richard. Melody and I spoke to the farmer, Dustin, about how he grows his rice and what selling rice to Walmart means for him and his community.\n\nThere’s also an exciting regeneration story: Walmart and our partners are working with Dustin and other Arkansas farmers to grow their rice using less water and with less greenhouse gas emissions. It’s really exciting, and Melody explained it so well in this episode.\n\nPlease watch, and learn how even a single bag of rice can support livelihoods in America AND regeneration.\n\nSave Money. Live Better.\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Walmart on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1tVy1CI  \r\nLike Walmart on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1qS59V6 \r\nFollow Walmart on Pinterest: http://bit.ly/1vR6XBY \r\nFollow Walmart on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1pMbNfy \r\nFollow Walmart on Instagram: http://bit.ly/1FMiiJX",

        "description": "At Walmart, our people have always driven our success. When I think of associates who are making the difference each day, I think of Marcie Bird. You may remember seeing Marcie on stage at Associates Week, where she shared her story about breaking barriers as the first Navajo Store Manager of Supercenter 906 in Gallup, NM.  \n  \nI had the privilege of having Marcie join me for an episode of The Huddle. We talked about her remarkable journey of growing up on a Navajo reservation to becoming the leader of a store with 500 associates. She also shares great insight about setting a positive example in her store, community, and across the country.  \n  \nOur people come from diverse backgrounds and bring unique life experiences, and Marcie’s story is a powerful reminder that with hard work, resilience, and determination, anyone can thrive at Walmart. I know you’ll enjoy this inspiring episode!\n\nSave Money.

Stephanie and Dell are two of the over 500,000 veterans and military spouses we’ve proudly hired the past ten years.\n\nIn this episode, they talked about what Memorial Day means to them, how their service shaped their values, and how they’re using their skills and passion for serving others here at Walmart. I hope you’ll listen, and also take the time to pause on Monday and think about those who gave everything. Thank you to Stephanie, Dell, and all our servicemembers for your selflessness and courage.

        "description": "It’s graduation season – and I know so many of us are thinking of the graduating students we know, and the sense of accomplishment, excitement, and nervousness they’re feeling right now. \n \nEvery May, I think back to MY time as a student at the University of Arkansas. I’ll never forget sitting in the back row of Dr. Jonathan L. Johnson's Business Strategy class, ­soaking up the knowledge and insights he had to offer. Although apparently not ALL of it, since I got a ‘B’ in the class! \n\nDr. Johnson and I are friends to this day, even though we still like to give each other a hard time about that ‘B.’ He joined me for this episode of The Huddle, and brought three of his most outstanding students – Sophia, Laurel, and Ali – who are all graduating with their MBAs this month. We talked about their experiences, their career goals and how they hope to apply the skills they've learned in class in the “real world.” We even had a little fun giving them a chance to take over The Huddle and ask me some questions. \n \nIf you’re an upcoming graduate or navigating the next steps in your own career, this episode is for you. And to all the graduates out there – congratulations! I’m rooting for you, and can’t wait to see the positive impact you’ll make in the world.\n\nSave Money.

        "description": "Someone once told me “your leadership is defined during the toughest times.” No one exemplifies that more than Alycia Mixon, the manager of Store 1841 in Chesapeake, VA. I met Alycia last November, under the most difficult circumstances imaginable – after losing 6 members of the Walmart family.\n\nAlycia’s first instinct was to step up for her people in a way that few others could. When I first saw her, she was standing on a chair, speaking to her team with the perfect balance of confidence and compassion. I visited 1841 last week, just as they started welcoming back customers, and it was great to see Alycia bringing her team into a new era for the store. For this episode of the Huddle, I talked with Alycia about how she’s continued to comfort and lead her team these past five months as they worked to remodel the store, build an outdoor memorial and reopen.\n\nWe’re committed to helping everyone at 1841 move forward, even as we continue to mourn the loss of six beautiful lives: Randy, Jesus, Lorenzo, Kellie, Brian, and Tyneka. And we’re so thankful for Alycia, who in the toughest of times, showed us what leadership looks like. \n\r\nSave Money.

Carvon Smith’s story is an amazing example of this. Carvon started working at Walmart in 2015, taking a part-time role in maintenance while he was in school. He soon took on a bigger role – and then another – and in January Carvon became the Manager at Store #530 in El Dorado, AR!  \n  \nIn this episode of The Huddle, I talk with Carvon at his first Year Beginning Meeting as a Store Manager about his journey, and his advice for others looking to grow in their career. He shares great insight about the importance of building on your strengths, learning from others, and keeping a positive mindset when leading teams through challenges. I am so impressed by Carvon, and we can all learn something from his “fire and desire” to make the difference.\n\nSave Money.

Our associates, customers, investors, suppliers, and business partners choose Walmart because they know we are a business they can trust. \n\nIn this special edition of The Huddle, I talk with Walmart’s Global Ethics Officer, Jelahn Stewart, about how our culture of integrity brought her to Walmart after two decades in government. From overseeing the U.S. Witness Protection Program, prosecuting felony cases, serving as Special Counsel in the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and more – Jelahn embodies living with integrity, and she has great insight on how we can all do the same. I hope you’ll listen to this important conversation, and I hope you commit to ALWAYS doing the right thing.  https://bit.ly/3gxON5F\n\nSave Money.

He’s also a musician, creative, and curious guy who our store associates are going to love working for.

        "description": "Every quarter, we get the opportunity to share our earnings results. I’m really proud we’ve seen historically unprecedented growth since this decade began – from our sales comps to our eCommerce business to operating income. \n\nAs we think about earnings, it's important to me we not only share the results but also help people understand what “earnings” means. That’s why I am so excited for our newest episode of the Huddle, where I’m joined by our CFO, John David Rainey. If you’ve ever wondered why we do earnings, how it affects the day-to-day lives of our associates and customers, or how to put the numbers into a big picture perspective – you’re going to love this one! John David has incredible experience and knowledge, and he does such a great job sharing how to make sense of it all. I hope you’ll listen, learn and feel as enthusiastic about the future of Walmart as we do! Full episode here: https://bit.ly/3gxON5F\n\n\nSave Money.

This first episode was filmed in front of an in-person audience at the National Retail Federation’s NRF 2023 conference – known as “Retail’s Big Show.” I’m proud to chair the NRF’s Board of Directors, and I was thrilled to introduce the audience to a big-time guest: Dr. James Cash. I’ve known Dr. Cash for many years, and I am so inspired by his story.  \n \nIn this episode, Dr. Cash talks about what drove him to break through so many hurdles and do things no one else had ever done – from becoming the first Black basketball player in the Southwest Conference to the first tenured Black faculty member at Harvard Business School. His mom taught him a mantra that he's always lived by: “If the elevator is broken, take the stairs.” I hope you’ll watch this episode and see the incredible power displayed in Dr. Cash’s perseverance. https://bit.ly/3gxON5F\n\n\n\n\nSave Money.

We treasure those delicious Thanksgiving and Christmas meals with our favorite dishes and family traditions.  \n  \nFor the Season 3 finale of the Huddle, I talked to John Laney, who runs Walmart’s U.S. food business. John talked about some of his favorite items, and how HIS family does holiday meals for their family of 10! John and I were especially proud to share how Walmart was able to strip the inflation out of an entire basket of holiday food items, so our customers can serve this year's big meals at last year’s price!  \n  \nI hope you'll enjoy this episode, and I hope you'll come to Walmart for all your holiday needs. Thank you so much for tuning in this year. Happy holidays! \n \nSave Money.

        "description": "On Veterans Day, we should all stop and think about the people who’ve served. We’re so grateful for everything they’ve done, to allow us to live in safety and freedom. On this episode of the Huddle, I was honored to speak with Christopher Aragon - an incredible Veteran with a heart for service. Chris recently retired from the Marine Corps after a 30-year career, and was thinking of the next chapter for himself and his family. Fortunately for us, he learned about Walmart through our Find a Future and Hiring our Heroes Career Bridge programs and landed as an Outbound Operations Manager in Chino, California. Chris is one of 80,000 Veterans and military spouses who have joined our team in the past year alone. They’re now serving Walmart customers with the same level of excellence they served their country.  Listen to Chris talk about his career in the military, what drew him to Walmart, and what Veterans Day means to him. Happy Veterans Day, and to Chris and every other Veteran: thank you!",

Four years ago, Tyler was excited to add another title to his resume: Kari’s Dad. Tyler and his wife Danielle used Walmart’s adoption benefit when they became the parents of their beautiful baby girl. Tyler joined me on the Huddle to talk about leading a small-town store that makes a big impact, making the decision to adopt, and how our adoption benefit and parental leave made the process easier. We also talked about how Walmart has expanded our adoption/surrogacy benefits from $5,000 to $20,000, and how our medical plan now supports fertility services. Families come in different shapes and sizes, and they start in many different ways. At Walmart, we’re proud to support all of them!",

She later became a Southwest pilot, and in April 2018 she was piloting a flight from New York City to Dallas that experienced a sudden engine failure. The plane was down an engine, and the explosion broke a window – causing the cabin to quickly depressurize. Tammie Jo stayed calm, immediately rerouted the plane, landed in Philadelphia, and even went back to speak with her passengers afterward. It was an honor to have Tammie Jo join me on the Huddle to talk about the experience, leadership, how she’s persevered against offenses, and how we must always “keep our wings level.”",

        "description": "Northwest Arkansas boasts a world-class system of mountain bike trails, which residents love to take advantage of in their leisure time. But what about building cycling into the day-to-day? By the time the new campus opens, the goal is for 10% of Walmart associates based at the Home Office to choose alternate forms of transportation – such as bikes – for their commutes. Leading this work is Kourtney Barrett, Walmart’s Director of Workplace Mobility, with support from cycling advocates Tom Walton and Steuart Walton. Associate Merchant Maddy Johnson is also tasked with buying adult bikes for Walmart: “More people on more bikes. That’s what it’s all about.” Breaking Ground allows viewers to hear from the experts behind the design and construction of Walmart’s new campus in Bentonville, Ark.",

We’re also proud to offer one of the best driving jobs out there! A new driver can now earn up to $110,000 in their first year with us, and we recently launched the Private Fleet Development Program which pays for Walmart associates to earn their commercial licenses. Levor Franklin is a recent graduate of that program, and we spent some time on the road for this new episode of The Huddle. Levor is a great driver and fantastic 18-year associate, and I’m excited for you to see him at work in this episode. And THANK YOU to all of our incredible drivers and technicians! We appreciate you.",

They were in Michigan for the Woodward Dream Cruise which is North America’s largest celebration of automotive culture - and, of course, Mr. Sam’s truck made an appearance. Jay is passionate about cars and started his own line of car care products called “Jay Leno’s Garage” about a decade ago. His items are developed, made and shipped from the U.S. and have been on our store shelves for a couple of years now. Listen to this new episode to hear Jay’s advice on how to keep innovating, make products that can reach more people, and ultimately - deliver and care for each customer.",

Getting to talk items, prepare for the upcoming season, and spend time with associates in person is always energizing - especially when they’re as passionate as Leidy Diaz. Leidy is the Store Manager at 2090 in Franklin, NJ. She moved to America from Colombia at 19 years old, has been with the company three years, and has been serving as SM for about a year. This was her first time coming to the Holiday meeting, and she loved getting to share experiences with fellow managers from across the country. Listen to this new episode of The Huddle to hear why some consider Leidy to be the mayor of her community.",

Veronica Moreno started the company in her home with just one tortilla machine, and today she employs hundreds of people across several communities. \n\nI recently had the pleasure of touring Olé’s Texas facilities and talking with Veronica and her son Edgar about the Olé story, and how they’re continuing to expand and invest. \n\nWalmart is passionate about supporting American entrepreneurs and businesses. This week, we held our ninth annual Open Call where more than 1,100 businesses from across the country pitched their products for a chance to see them on store shelves, Walmart.com, or our Walmart Marketplace. And we’ve pledged to spend an additional $350 billion over the next 10 years on products made, grown, or assembled in the U.S. That investment will support the creation of an estimated 750,000 new U.S. jobs. \n\nIt’s amazing to think of the difference we can make for so many lives by buying and selling products that support American jobs. I hope you’ll join me in reflecting on that this weekend as we celebrate our nation’s 246th birthday. Happy Fourth of July and thank you!",

We’ve all been through so much, and while things won’t go back to the way they were - we're excited to start having a bit more fun with merchandise.

        "description": "Get ready for a Valentine’s showstopper that’s perfect for your special someone, the kids, even a Galentine’s Day party! It’s a Valentine’s Day cookie pizza & homemade strawberry milk. Chow Down chef Carolina Gelen shows you how to make this perfect combination of rich, chocolatey goodness & delicious, fruity freshness. Decorate the cookie pizza with the kids or the gals—have fun with it, we promise it’s going to look great! For more recipes that will wow your loved ones, like & subscribe.\n\nGet ingredients for this recipe: https://walmrt.us/3rptCLg\nFollow Carolina on Instagram at @carolinagelen\n\nValentine’s Day cookie pizza ingredients:\n(Makes 1) \n\n1 roll refrigerated chocolate chip cookie dough\nFlour for dusting \nMarshmallow Fluff (about half of a 7.5 oz container)\nRed, white, & pink candy-coated chocolates\nHeart sprinkles \n1/2 cup hot fudge\n\nInstructions:\n1) Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  Flip your sheet tray upside down so that it is a flat surface without a lip, then line it with parchment paper. \n2) Dust surface with flour.  Divide stick of dough into 2 pieces, one that is approximately 2/3 of the stick, & the remaining piece (about 1/3 of the stick). Using your hands, start pressing the pieces into the two sides of a heart, with the larger piece making the pointed base.  Once you have a basic heart shape, gently use your rolling pin to flatten the dough, reshaping with your hands when necessary.  Keep rolling the dough down until it is about 1/2 inch thick.  It’s okay if the shape is a little rustic looking.\n3) Gently transfer dough to a sheet tray lined with parchment paper & bake for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown. \n4) Once removed from the oven, reshape the heart with a knife by trimming the edges of the cookie while cookie is still hot. Let cool thoroughly.\n5) Spread Marshmallow Fluff over the cookie, as if icing a cake, creating a base layer on the pizza cookie.  \n6) Top with candy-coated chocolates & heart sprinkles, or any sprinkles & candies your heart desires.\n7) Heat hot fudge per package directions, then mix with a teaspoon of water at a time until you can easily drizzle it with a spoon.  Drizzle hot fudge over cookie pizza & serve.\n\nStrawberry milk ingredients:\n(Makes 1) \n16 oz strawberries (fresh or frozen), quartered\n3/4 cup granulated sugar\n2/3 cup water\nMilk (can be non-dairy if desired)\nMarshmallow Fluff for the rim (optional) \nHeart sprinkles for the rim (optional)\n \nInstructions:\n1) Combine strawberries, sugar, & water in a saucepan over medium heat.  Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until slightly thickened. Turn off the heat.\n2) Transfer strawberry mixture carefully into a blender, taking care to avoid splashes. Place lid on blender, then remove the center cap from lid. Cover the hole with a towel.  Holding the towel in place with your hand, blend thoroughly. Transfer to a container & refrigerate until cold.\n3) Dip the rim of your serving glass into Marshmallow Fluff, then dip into a shallow plate of sprinkles. Fill serving glass about 2/3 full with milk, then add strawberry syrup slowly, stirring to incorporate, until you’ve reached the desired color & taste.",

Our founder, Sam Walton, was an Army veteran - and so many of our associates have served. Since 2013, we’ve hired more than 400,000 veterans and military spouses to join our team, like Rhonda Jeter and Glenn Garay. Rhonda served in the Air Force for 10 years, is a loyal Walmart associate and was recently promoted to Store Manager at Store 399 in Longview, TX! Glenn is a first-generation American from Colombia, served 24 years in the Air Force and joined Walmart just two months ago as the first fellow hired in Global Tech through the Hiring our Heroes fellowship. They both have incredible stories and joined The Huddle with John Furner to talk about what serving our country has meant to them and the opportunities at Walmart for veterans.",

Wig shared firsthand the impact our pharmacy associates have on care and the relationship they build with their patients. We appreciate everything our pharmacy teams do every day, especially throughout the pandemic, and they are rightfully in the spotlight for National Pharmacy Week.

Building a single omnichannel platform has been a large undertaking and required the close partnership of several teams including Technology, Design, Business and Product.

        "description": "Today marks 20 years since the attacks of September 11th. John Furner was a Store Manager in Jacksonville, NC, and distinctly remembers sharing the news with his team - several of which had family members and loved ones serving in the military. In that same moment, Dan Bartlett was with President George W. Bush. Dan is our EVP of Corporate Affairs and came to Walmart after a career in government as Communications Director and Counselor to the President. Dan joined The Huddle to talk about the events of that day - from first hearing the news to conversations had on Air Force One to standing in the Oval Office as President Bush addressed the nation. Our country was forever changed September 11, 2001, but we have stayed resilient and learned to rely on each other and support one another. Please take a moment to remember the 2,977 men, women and children killed that day and to honor the brave first responders who ran toward danger to save others. Two decades ago, we made a promise never to forget. Let us recommit ourselves to fulfilling it together.",

He’s since worked retail in nine different countries and knows no matter where you are, being curious helps you best serve customers.

In order to continue innovating and moving forward, we have to be ready and willing to unite, grow and transform. Mayor Scott is the first Black mayor elected by popular vote in Little Rock, Arkansas, and he often talks about the importance of transformation to achieve our best selves. Our associates across the U.S. prove this time and time again while protecting one another and serving our customers. Listen to this new episode of The Huddle to hear why John is proud of the work we’ve done and grateful to learn from inspirational leaders like Mayor Scott.",

Together they opened a family business in the Minneapolis area back in 1946 called Nordic Ware. After responding to Mr. Sam’s call for American manufacturers, Nordic Ware’s signature Bundt pan landed on our store shelves in 1986. Decades later they are now one of our longtime suppliers selling dozens of items, and John Furner recently toured their factory in person. We made a commitment earlier this year to spend an additional $350 billion on items made, grown or assembled in the U.S., and as we kick off our 8th annual Open Call this week, companies like Nordic Ware are what it’s all about. We welcome entrepreneurs from all over the country to virtually present their products to our merchandise buyers for a chance to get started with Walmart, just like Jenny’s family. Listen to this new episode of The Huddle with John Furner to hear their story.",
