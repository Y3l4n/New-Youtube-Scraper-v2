The Norwegian musician born Kyrre Gørvell-Dahll first introduced himself in 2013 and quietly became one of the most ubiquitous hitmakers in the world. Amassing 23 billion cumulative global audio and video streams by 2022, he has broken numerous streaming records. Kygo earned one of his biggest hits with the multiplatinum “It Ain’t Me” (feat. Selena Gomez), going Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and clocking over 2.9 billion streams worldwide. In 2019, Kygo unleashed “Higher Love” with Whitney Houston and generated another 1.4 billion combined streams/views worldwide and peaked at #1 on Dance Radio in addition to leaving his imprint on a classic. He heralded his 2020 critically acclaimed third full-length album Golden Hour [Sony Music International/Ultra Records/RCA Records] with the anthems “Like It Is” (feat. Zara Larsson & Tyga), “Lose Somebody” (with OneRepublic), and “I’ll Wait” (feat. Sasha Alex Sloan). The album has garnered over 2.5 billion streams worldwide.

The album debuted at the top of the charts; her third consecutive album to debut at No.1 on the Billboard Album chart. Most recently, Selena released her well received EP “Relevación”, her first all-Spanish language music project which was nominated for a Latin Grammy.  Through her July Moon Productions Gomez has produced a fearless slate of both television and film including the hit Netflix original series “13 Reasons Why.”  She went on to produce the lauded Netflix docu-series “Living Undocumented.  Gomez executive produces and appears on the buzzworthy hit HBO Max cooking series “Selena + Chef.”  Most recently, Selena executive produced and stars in the critically acclaimed Hulu series “Only Murders in the Building” opposite comedy legends Steve Martin and Martin Short. The hit series was picked up for a second season.  Last year, Gomez launched her beauty line Rare Beauty exclusively with Sephora.  As part of the partnership, Gomez launched the Rare Impact Fund, pledging to raise $100 million for mental health services for individuals in underserved communities.\n\n#Coldplay #SelenaGomez #LetSomebodyGo #MusicOfTheSpheres #MOTS #MoonMusic",
