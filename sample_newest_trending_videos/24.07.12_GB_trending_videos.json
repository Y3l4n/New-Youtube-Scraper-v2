        "description": "I've got a handful of old trucks sitting in a cow pasture in North Dakota.  They've been there for years, and some of these I have no idea when they were on the road last.  I'm looking to haul my 4 wheeler back home to Tennessee.  I picked out a 1975 Chevrolet Cheyenne Super as my wheels.  The problem is, it's got a locked up motor AND rear end.  Will it run again and make the 1,500 mile trip?\n\nFIND MERCHANDISE HERE:\nhttps://www.vicegripgarage.com\n\nTO SHOW YOUR SUPPORT:\nHave you checked out memberships?

She moved with purpose, knowing exactly what she wanted and how to achieve it. Her declarative statement, \"I'm everything,\" from \"BOOM BAP\" off her Grammy-nominated mixtape, ALLIGATOR BITES NEVER HEAL, was on full display in her Tiny Desk debut.\n\nBacked by a full band, horns and two background singers, Doechii's performance was a masterclass in creativity. Sporting vintage academia looks, complete with matching cornrows and beads, Doechii delivers a freshly rearranged medley of cuts from ALLIGATOR BITES NEVER HEAL, tailored specifically for Tiny Desk. While hip-hop remained at the core, she truly gave us everything: a jazz arrangement of \"BOOM BAP,\" heavy rock vibes on \"CATFISH\" and a Southern praise break outro on \"NISSAN ALTIMA.\"\n\nShe closed her set with \"Black Girl Memoir\" from her debut album, Oh The Places You'll Go. Before performing, she shared, \"I wrote this song specifically for Black women. As a dark-skinned woman, there's a very unique experience I'm trying to internalize ‚Ä¶ This is dedicated to all the beautiful Black women in the room.\" While her star has been steadily on the rise since her debut, 2024 is shaping up to be the year Doechii cements herself as a household name.\n\nSET LIST\n\"BOOM BAP\"\n\"BOILED PEANUTS\"\n\"DENIAL IS A RIVER\"\n\"CATFISH\"\n\"NISSAN ALTIMA\"\n\"BULLFROG\"\n\"HIDE N SEEK\"\n\"Black Girl Memoir\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nDoechii: vocals\nTyler Victoria: guitar\nDee Simone: drums\nTatiana Tate: trumpeter, arrangement\nHammondgal: keyboards \nDJ Miss Milan: vocals\nBREN'NAE: background vocals\nEmmani: background vocals\nKeschia Potter : saxophone\nZuri Appleby: bassist\nSlimWav: musical direction\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Ashley Pointer, Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Sofia Seidel, Wendy Li\nAudio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistant: Elle Mannion\nPhotographer: Alant√© Serene\nTiny Desk Team: Maia Stern, Hazel Cills\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #doechii \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Better Help, committed to making mental well-being a priority\nand offering support in taking on everything life demands.

        "title": "Galaxy Quest Review",
        "description": "Mike and Jack sit down to talk about the cult classic film ‚ÄúGalaxy Quest‚Äù starring Tim Allen and many others. A film that has gained popularity over the years and days since it was released. Mike and Jack come at this film with different perspectives, while both appreciating it as the wonderful magical fun adventure film it is with fantastic visual FX and monsters, Jack sees the film as the memorable movie he grew up with and helped to mold his love for cinema and acting. Mike (being 37 years older than Jack) sees the film as a magical what-could-have-been kind of thing. He smells the studio meddling like a wet fart from afar.  The potential for a PG-13 or R rated dry, vulgar comedy was there, but watered down by a spineless studio that wanted to G-rated Tim Allen comedy. Would it have flopped as a more adult film? Would it have been better if they went full kids tale? Don‚Äôt ya know no one will ever know! It‚Äôs a slippery pig that‚Äôs been oiled up with K-Y jelly. Mike tries to grab a hold of that piggy to see what it done be. Jack is happy with what the movie is. Mike can‚Äôt see the forest through the trees. He loves all the moments in the film. So many good moments and character choices and fun gags. But at what cost? Who done they make this movie for? Trek fans love it. But maybe not all Trek fans love it? I don't know. Kids and Parents of all ages love it. The elderly would love it if they weren‚Äôt dead. Even foreign folks from other nations love it. What would it have been if it was made with the TOS Star Trek actors or even the TNG actors. I for one am glad it was not. While a fun \"what if\" to think about it, it would have broken the 4th wall to a degree that would have been too much. They could get away with it in that one movie Wes Craven's New Nightmare, but that's just a Freddy movie. Not super important. Certainly not as much has Star Trek. Anyways, Galaxy Quest does indeed work as a movie. It tells the timeless tale of characters who are less than great and struggle to know themselves are thrust into a challenge and have to find it in themselves to be better and make the difference. Campbell‚Äôs Soup calls it the Hero‚Äôs Journey with Chicken and Stars. Extra noodles please!",

The video shows the entire project which took 2 and a half months of work. It begins with the making of a thatched A-frame hut as a workshop for making tiles. The tiles were made from clay and fired in a kiln made from bricks made in previous videos. A 2x2 m hut was then built by making two walls of mud in the shape of a wall and gable. Between 1.25 and 1.6 tons of soil were used to make these walls. The roof was formed by spanning the two walls with timber that was then covered with tiles. The hut shed rain reasonably well but it remains to be seen how it will fair in the long wet season which is starting now. The main benefit of this hut is how little material is used in the walls considering that there are no side walls, significantly reducing labor and materials. It will be an experiment in how this building method works.\n\n00:00 - Building the tile workshop\n05:20 - Clay preparation\n08:11 - Making roof tiles\n12:18 - Building kiln\n13:53 - Fire by friction\n15:46 - Stacking kiln\n17:20 - Firing tile batch 1\n18:47 - Result and water test\n20:51 - Firing tile batch 2\n24:18 - Firing tile batch 3 (plus small pot)\n27:31 - Making next round of tiles\n32:16 - Building the hut foundations\n33:31 - Building mud walls\n35:15 - Protecting walls from rain \n36:21 - Finishing walls\n37:46 - Timber roof\n39:31 - Tiling roof\n40:33 - Firing batch 4 and tiling\n43:46 - Firing batch 5 and tiling\n44:40 - Firing batch 6 and tiling\n46:01 - Finished hut\n46:28 - Hut in a rainstorm\n47:31 - Hearth fire in hut\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

        "title": "How Shopping Malls Are Being Transformed Into Apartments In The U.S.",
        "description": "While many U.S. malls face anchor store closures and empty parking lots, some are finding new life by becoming housing. Real estate developers are building housing inside of or next to shopping malls as department stores like Macy‚Äôs, JCPenney and Sears shrink or cease to exist. At least 192 U.S. malls planned to add housing to their footprint as of January 2022. Dozens of apartment projects at malls are underway in California, Colorado, Florida, Arizona and Texas. The trend not only helps to chip away the housing shortage in the U.S., but also brings people closer to the remaining retail and restaurant spaces in shopping centers. CNBC visited a Macerich housing project at Flatiron Crossing Mall in Broomfield, Colorado as well as the Arcade Mall in Providence, Rhode Island to find out what it is like to live inside a mall.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Introduction\n2:13: Chapter 1 - Living in a mall\n4:45: Chapter 2 - The new anchor store: housing\n6:59: Chapter 3 - Challenges\n\nCREDITS\nProduced by: DeLon Thornton\nSenior Producer and Camera: Shawn Baldwin\nEdited by: Evan Lee Miller\nReporter: Gabrielle Fonrouge\nGraphics by: Jason Regniato\nAdditional Camera: Juliana Broste\nSupervising Producer: Jeniece Pettitt\n\n\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC \n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision \n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

        "description": "I challenged myself to creatively use as many cleaning supplies as possible for a camping trip. From shelter and cooking to fire starting, I used everything I could think of. It was a great evening camping by a small creek in the woods. It got a little bit cold and a small skiff of snow, but huddled by the campfire I stayed warm until I crawled into my cozy garbage bag shelter.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n‚Ä¢ Website: https://campingwithsteve.com\n‚Ä¢ My Amazon store: https://amzn.to/49li5Az\n‚Ä¢ Merch https://crowdmade.com/collections/stevewallis\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGear:\n\nCamera: Sony Alpha FX3\nhttps://amzn.to/3SIMQra\n\nLens: Sony FE PZ 16-35mm F4 G\nhttps://amzn.to/3SL1rm7\n\nEditing: Apple 2021 MacBook Pro M1 Final Cut Pro\nhttps://amzn.to/3YeuCiy\n\nDrone: DJI Mini 3\nhttps://amzn.to/3YqQ0Ew\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nSocials: \n‚Ä¢ Facebook: https://facebook.com/campingwithsteve\n‚Ä¢ Instagram: https://instagram.com/campingsteve\n‚Ä¢ Twitter/X: https://twitter.com/hunkerdownsteve\n‚Ä¢ TikTok: https://tiktok.com/@campingwithsteve\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#hunkerdown #stealthcamping #camping #cleaningsupplies",

        "description": "I Added My Friend To Minecraft... like, he can actually play the game in real life. So we try and beat it! Minecraft and real life fused together! Fusion.\n\nSUPPORT THIS PROJECT: https://dream.shop/\n\nFollow my socials:\n‚ûΩ Twitter - @dreamwastaken\n‚ûΩ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n‚ûΩ Snapchat - @dreampublic\n\nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound \n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/DreamWasTaken\n\nThere were tons of changes and improvements to the real-life-video-game fusion process, as you can probably tell by watching this video. I want to talk about it more in the future, maybe with a DreamXD video. There were tons of bugs in this video, and this recording took forever, so we decided to fix a lot of the bugs and record another one on George's channel, which should also be up now! In that video we added a health bar above their head, fixed a lot of issues including with vehicles, and overall made it cleaner.\n\nIf you have any suggestions for features, or any cool ideas for videos using this, let us know! We definitely plan on doing a good mix of videos with and without this tech. This was a ton of fun though, and was such an interesting way to experience Minecraft.\n\nThis is a Minecraft 1.20/1.21 challenge. This is not a Minecraft Manhunt video, but it is a Minecraft survival challenge, like \"Minecraft, But\". We use \"Fusion\", our real life technology, with some coding magic, to put real life people into video games. They can be seen in 3D in the world, and can interact with things using their hands, feet, and every part of their body. It's hilarious, a ton of fun, and the perfect way to merge real life and Minecraft. They can PVP, build, break, and survive!\n\nWe've spent a ton of time and effort on this project, so drop a like and subscribe if you want to show support :)",

We spent the last few months working on all the feedback you gave. From the model, to the movement and more. We hope these changes are something ye like. And we already have done more very good changes since we made this video. A better suit, adjustments to the player model and we are learning along the way to be the best we can. So thank you from the heart for all your help and support. Every video you watch counts and matter. We just hope that ye enjoy. God bless ye!",

So yeah, I marched off a couple miles into the hills of Alaska with no tent, no sleeping bag and no tarp. I made a winter survival shelter and demonstrate the best winter time survival shelter if you don't want to freeze to death. It dropped well bellow 0F (-18C) and I cooked moose ribs and baked bread on the coals.

        "title": "This Is The World's First Geared CVT and It Will Blow Your Mind -  Ratio Zero Transmission",
        "description": "https://www.ratiozero.com/\nSupport the channel by shopping through this link: https://amzn.to/3RIqU0u\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/d4a\nBecome a member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwosUnVH6AINmxtqkNJ3Fbg/join\nGrit: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt3YSIPcvJsYbwGCDLNiIKA\n\nToday I have the privilege to hold in my hands something special. It is called Ratio Zero and it is the worlds first operational gear based cvt But before I explain how this piece of mechanical poetry actually works allow me to first explain why a gear based CVT is a big deal. \n\nAs you probably know CVT stands for continuously variable transmission and from the perspective of fuel efficiency, smoothness and ease of use they are the ultimate transmission. And while I would not choose a CVT transmission for a vehicle that I want to take to a twisty mountain road or to the track where I want to enjoy revving the engine out through the gears, I would gladly choose a CVT for a vehicle that I drive everyday on the highway or in boring stop-and go commuter traffic. \n\nA traditional manual or automatic transmission has a set number of gear ratios or speeds\n\nFor example, a gear ratio of 3.6:1 tells us that for every 3.6 revolution of the engine, the wheels only make one revolution while the torque at the wheels is increased 3.6 times. So the frist gear reduces vehicle but increases torque, this is why it‚Äôs used for getting the vehicle moving from a standstill and top climb steep hills. \n\nA manual or automatic transmission will usually have anywhere between 4 to 8 such gear ratios which we call speeds. Compared to this a CVT will only have two ‚Äúgear ratios‚Äù or speeds. This is because a cvt does not have gears Instead we have two conical pulleys and a belt or chain running around them. We slide the belt along these pulleys and the different sizes of the pulleys at different parts of the cone simulate an endless number of different gear sizes which means that a CVT has an endless number of ratios in this range between its lowest and highest ratio. So if an automatic or manual is a 6 speed or 7 speed or whatever than a CVT is a million speed transmission or an infinite number of speeds transmission. \n\nOk, if CVTs are so great why aren‚Äôt they more popular? Why aren‚Äôt they on every car, truck, motorcycle, bicycle? \n\nWell, that‚Äôs because traditional CVTs, they kinda suck. \n\nTheir first problem is that although they help the engine be more efficient, they themselves are  not very efficient at all and that‚Äôs because friction is at the very core of the design of a CVT. If you observe the inner workings you will see that torque is transferred between the pulleys by a belt or a chain. The belt or chain has nothing to grip onto, there are no gear teeth, no notches, no grabbing points, which means that the belt tension or the friction between the belt itself and the smooth surface of the pulley cone are the only thing transferring the torque. Which means that to transfer substantial amounts of torque we need substantial friction and as we know friction leads to efficiency losses, heat and wear. This is why a typical belt or chain CVT in a car is around 80-88% efficient, a more simple scooter CVT is around 70-75% efficient whereas a geared manual transmission is 95-97% efficient in almost all applications. \n\nThis is why researchers, inventors and many others have been trying to create a transmission that combines the smoothness, ease of use, fuel efficiency and continually variable gear ratios of the CVT with the torque capacity and low friction of a geared transmission.\n\nDespite repeated efforts there has been little success, until in 2016 a man named Edyson Pavlicu had a breakthrough idea - to split the rotation and create the world's  first geared CVT transmission  - Ratio Zero.\n\nA special thank you to my patrons:\nDaniel\nPeter Della Flora\nDave Westwood\nToma Marini\nZwoa Meda Beda\nvalqk\nCole Philips\nMarwan Hassan11\nRePeteAndMe\nSam Lutfi\n\n00:00 The Problem with Manuals and Automatics\n04:24 The Problem with Traditional CVTs\n08:03 Splitting The Rotation\n15:12 A Better Prototype",
